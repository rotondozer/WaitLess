# WaitLess

React Native + TypeScript app (_in progress of being ported from [waitlist_browser](https://github.com/rotondozer/waitlist)_) for a restaurant host to organize and prioritize guests on a waitlist and tables in the restaurant. This app also aims to track and calculate data to pertaining to wait times and turnover rate to provide a better customer experience and a deeper understanding of your restaurant's turnover efficiency.

Motivation for this app comes from years of restaurant work experience, where I wish I had a tool to help multitasking while managing the floor and hosting busy brunch or dinner service. I wanted to create an app that would provide useful data to the host regarding wait times and table turnover rates, as well as keeping track of guests on a waitlist and the availability of tables.
